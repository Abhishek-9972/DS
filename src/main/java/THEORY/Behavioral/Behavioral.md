4) Challenges Faced
   
    Tax Reporting Project = Bringing from third party system to in-house solution
    
   One of the biggest challenges I faced was during the implementation of the Tax Reporting project. Transitioning from a third-party system to an in-house solution required a deep understanding of complex regulatory requirements and significant coordination with various stakeholders. Additionally, ensuring data accuracy and system scalability under tight deadlines was challenging. However, through careful planning, rigorous testing, and effective collaboration, we successfully delivered the project, which greatly enhanced our operational efficiency.

5) Trade Off
    
    LTA - Project Delivery Time : Important to have that as Backlog


   A significant trade-off I encountered was balancing between system robustness and delivery speed. For the Tax Reporting project, there was pressure to deliver quickly due to regulatory deadlines. However, cutting corners on robustness could lead to potential compliance issues. We opted to prioritize building a resilient system, even if it meant extending the timeline slightly, to ensure long-term stability and compliance.

6) Strength and Weakness
    
   Strength : Lead Team
              Look Problem from both the end user perspective as well as an architect perspective
              
   Weakness : Getting too involved in project

   Strength: One of my core strengths is my ability to lead cross-functional teams and drive projects to successful completion. I am adept at problem-solving and thrive in challenging environments where I can leverage my technical and managerial skills to deliver high-quality results.

   Weakness: I sometimes get too involved in the details of a project, which can lead to micromanagement. I've been working on trusting my team more and delegating effectively to balance this tendency.

7) How Do You Give Estimates
    
    - Break project into smaller tasks
    - Do brainstorm on each smaller tasks
    - HLD
    - Consulting with team members
    - Use Historical data
    

   I provide estimates by breaking down the project into smaller tasks, consulting with team members to gauge the effort required for each task, and considering any potential risks or dependencies. I also use historical data from similar projects to inform my estimates and add buffer time for unexpected issues. Regular check-ins and adjustments ensure that we stay on track.

8) What Will You Do if One of Your Team Members is Not Performing Well
    
    - One on One with the team member
    - Try to understand the root cause
